            <p>Eighty years ago, scientists did not know how to manufacture PFAS. Now, we cannot get rid of them.
              <br><br>Almost every PFAS molecule ever synthesised is still out there. Some do break down –
              but into new PFAS.
              <br><br>These “Forever Chemicals” are in the soil, in raindrops, in our
              food, in our blood. They can cause cancers, hormone and immune disruption, and much more.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step3">
          <p>PFAS are man-made chemicals emitted into the environment from factories that produce or use them in
            their industrial processes.
            <br><br>They are discharged directly into water streams. PFAS pollution from
            smokestacks ends up in the soil. Industrial waste containing PFAS is often landfilled.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step4">
          <p> PFAS enter the human body through food, air, and skin.
            <br><br>Some remain in our bodies and can damage our health. Some are expelled and end up in wastewater.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step5">
          <p>Every fire ever extinguished using PFAS foams and every firefighting drill that has ever sprayed
            these foams have released PFAS into the environment.
            <br><br>They are still there.
            <br><br>These chemicals hide in soil and buildings, their contamination gradually affecting
            surrounding waters, ecosystems, and human populations.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step6">
          <p> Many everyday products contain PFAS. Waste eventually decomposes, but the PFAS do not.
            <br><br>They leach out of landfills to pollute groundwater and rivers. Gasses emitted by landfills also
            contain PFAS.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step7">
          <p>To this day, in many parts of Europe, PFAS are spread directly onto fields in at least four ways:
            <br><br>1. Pesticides with PFAS are sprayed onto crops.
            <br><br>2. Sewage sludge not checked for PFAS is used as fertiliser.
            <br><br>3. Reclaimed water from wastewater treatment plants not checked for PFAS is used for irrigation.
            <br><br>4. Tiny droplets containing PFAS are suspended in the air and come down as rain.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step8">
          <p>The chemical industry has known about PFAS hazards for seven decades.
            <br><br>When it started facing
            legal and regulatory threats and could no longer hold on to the first generation of PFAS,
            it created <span class="highlight-red">smaller PFAS</span> that are just as indestructible and even more mobile.
            <br><br>They are now found everywhere, especially in plants and water – and they accumulate fast. This is
            called "regrettable substitution".
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step9">
          <div>
            <p>No wonder PFAS end up on our plate, in rising concentrations, that will continue rising unless PFAS production stops.</p>

            <span class="costtitle"><b>Cost: between 2 and 14 billion euros </span></b>
            <br><br>The journalists of the Forever Lobbying Project teamed up with scientists to calculate
            the financial cost of bringing the PFAS crisis under control.
            <br><br> They started with legacy PFAS, big “long-chain” molecules that are restricted or banned
            but remain in the environment.
            <br><br>For decades, these chemicals were used to make non-stick pans,
            single-use food packaging, and stain-resistant textiles. Experts call them the EFSA 4:
            PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS.

        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step11">
          <p>Cleaning up the most concentrated sources of long-chain PFAS in Europe would cost anywhere between <br>
             <span class="cost"><b>2 and 14 billion euros </span></b>in the next 20 years.
            <br><br>Our societies — or, in rare cases, the polluters — must face these financial costs
            even if PFAS use stops immediately.
            <br><br>If we continue emitting, the bill will multiply.

          <p><span class="steptitle"><b>Getting rid of all PFAS</b></span><br>
            <span class="costtitle"><b>Cost: 2 trillion euros over 20 years</span></b>
            <br><br>Short-chain and ultrashort-chain PFAS, like TFA, are extremely mobile and can very easily enter the
            cells of living creatures.
            <br><br>Those molecules are so small they bypass most water filters.
            <br><br>It would cost around <span class="cost"><b>100 billion euros every year</span></b> to
            remove
            short-chain and ultrashort-chain PFAS,
            even partially, from the environment and to destroy them. That’s more than two trillion over 20 years.<br><br>
            That is <b>2.000.000.000.000 €</b>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step13">
          <p>We cannot remove PFAS from human blood, sea foam or rain. But there is still a lot that can be done.
            <br><br>If the EU acts now, we can prevent concentrations of emerging PFAS like TFA from reaching harmful
            levels in our drinking water.
            <br><br>An alliance of forever polluters claim that only the previous generation of PFAS is problematic.
            These polluters are orchestrating an <a href="https://foreverpollution.eu/lobbying/lobbying-disinformation/">EU-wide
              lobbying and disinformation campaign</a> to derail a proposed European ban on PFAS.
            <br><br>If they are successful, we will all be the subjects of a gigantic, irreversible experiment on a
            planetary scale.
